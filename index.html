    <b>Masked Up</b> is one of the newest designer protections against all COVID variants including Omicron.
    <b>Masked Up</b> masks are NIOSH(National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health) & CDC (Center for Disease Control)  approved. They meet new standards for Personal Protective Equipment, have been tested to ensure that they perform at a consistent level and are reusable.
    Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and while indoors at U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and train stations. <!--Source (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)-->
    
   <h2>How to Select A Proper Mask</h2>
    When selecting a mask, there are many choices. It is essential to choose masks that:
    -	have 2 or more layers of breathable fabric 
    -	completely cover your nose and mouth;
    -	fit snugly against the sides of your face and don't have gaps.
    -	have a nose wire to prevent air from leaking out of the top of the mask

    Masked Up meets all of these requirements with the added benefit of stylish design.
