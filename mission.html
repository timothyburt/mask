     <h1>Mission Statement for 2022</h1> 
     <h3>Origins</h3>
     <p>We started this company to do our part in helping the fabric of our community become safer while reducing the overall spread. We have found that following the CDC guidelines for cleaning hands, wearing masks when around others, and getting vaccinated along with booster shots, provides the best level of defense against this virus and its variants.</p>

               <h3>Goals</h3>
               <p>Here at Masked Up, we are striving to place as much protection as possible into the hands of every citizen in our local community with our CDC-approved masks. Our model is to sell our masks in packs and donate a portion of the masks to be distributed to people who cannot afford masks during this pandemic.</p>

               <h3>Plans</h3>
               <p>We hope that our overall mission spreads beyond our local community and other local communities can partner with us to protect everyone.</p>
