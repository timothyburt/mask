   <h2>How to Select A Proper Mask</h2>
  <div class="paragraph"> 
     <div> <p> When selecting a mask, there are many choices. It is essential to choose masks that:
    <ul>
        <li>have 2 or more layers of breathable fabric</li> 
        <li>completely cover your nose and mouth</li>
        <li>fit snugly against the sides of your face and don't have gaps</li>
        <li>have a nose wire to prevent air from leaking out of the top of the mask</li>
    </ul>
