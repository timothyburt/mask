  <div id="paragraph2">
    <p> When selecting a mask, there are many choices. It is essential to choose masks that:<br>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>have 2 or more layers of breathable fabric</li> 
        <li>completely cover your nose and mouth</li>
        <li>fit snugly against the sides of your face and don't have gaps</li>
        <li>have a nose wire to prevent air from leaking out of the top of the mask</li>
    </ul></p> 
    <!--Source (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html) -->
